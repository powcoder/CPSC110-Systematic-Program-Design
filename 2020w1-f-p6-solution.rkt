(@problem 1) ;THIS IS REALLY PROBLEM 6.  DO NOT EDIT OR DELETE THIS LINE!
#|
This problem involves a fair amount of careful thinking and then a small amount
of editing.  Work slowly and systematically, and do not make it harder than it
needs to be.

Below is a function to solve nqueens puzzles.  In an nqueens puzzle the goal is
to try to find a way to put n chess queens on an nxn chess board. This code
works properly as it appears below.  It has the behaviour of trying to solve the
puzzle for the given board size.  If it can't it fails by producing false; if it
can it produces the first set of queen positions it found that solve the puzzle.
There are no bugs or any other hidden problems with this code.

In working on this program, one interesting question to consider is how many
boards does the search visit before it finds a solution.  We don't care how many
if it fails.

What we want you to do is revise the function so that when it finds a solution,
instead of producing the solution (the board), it instead produces the total
number of boards fn-for-board visited to find that solution.

To help you here are some more details about what you need to do.  We stress
again, that this problem involves careful thinking more than lots of typing.

Clearly the signature and purpose change.  In addition the check-expects have to
change.  To help, we are telling you that the correct answers for n 1 to 8 are:

   1    2
   2    false
   3    false
   4    16
   5    6
   6    251
   7    12
   8    1970

you may also need to change the template tag, and you definitely need to edit
some parts of the function definition. But once again we stress think carefully
and make focused systematic edits.  That's the key to this problem.

You must NOT CHANGE THE LANGUAGE THE STARTER FILE IS SET TO.  Your solution must
use the intermediate student with lambda language.
