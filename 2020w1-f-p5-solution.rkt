;; =================
;; Functions:


;;
;; There is some redunancy in the bodies of the appear-one-mole and
;; disappear-mole-at-xy functions.  We want you to produce the design
;; for an abstract function based on these two functions.  We want you
;; to:
;;
;;   - design a new function called find-and-replace based on
;;     abstraction from these two examples
;;   - your design of find-and-replace should include signature,
;;     purpose, tests, template tag and function
;;   - then go back and revise the function definitions for appear-one-mole
;;     and disappear-mole-at-xy so that they both call find-and-replace
;;     You will also want to update the @template tag for appear-one-mole
;;     and disappear-mole-at-xy
;;   - DO NOT ADD ANY NEW TESTS FOR APPEAR-ONE-MOLE OR DISAPPEAR-MOLE-AT-XY
;;     as part of the refactoring.
;;   - If you write tests for find-and-replace that end up calling
;;     overlapped-by? you must make sure to only call overlapped-by? with
;;     the same arguments that the existing tests call it with.  We have
;;     a special stub for overlapped-by? at the end of the file and it
;;     only works for those arugments.
;;
;;
;; As always, a file that does not run will lose a significant number of marks.
;; Run your work often, so that you can check and fix errors as soon as they
;; creep in.  Also be sure to run every time before you submit.
